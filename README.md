# Getting started

## Installing Rust
Go to `https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/` and install rustup
Rustup comes with the rust compiler `rustc` and the package manager `cargo`

ensure you have rustup in your `PATH`

call `rustc --version` for verification

## IDE

I reccommend vscode, however you can also use Intellij

### vscode

extension: `rust-analyzer`
if you get errors regarding analyzer versions, update vscode and then the extension

### Intellij

Plugin: `Rust`

# Running you appplication

`cargo install` to install necessary modules
`cargo build` to build the exe
`cargo run` to build and run application
